# Technologies

I recommend to use web technologies because they are the most flexible an open source,
for example, the code base can be used to create applications for console,
desktop, web and mobile all those with small changes.

More specific Angular and Electron, which is open source, I'm used to this
framework, and it is pretty flexible for any platform (except for IoT for
example Arduino). And the amount of developers who use the web stack is widely.

## Disadvantages

Web stack is not very performant stack, but the problem to solve in hands it doesn't
requiere big performant.

## Sub-technologies

Ionic is a framework focus in the user side/interface, but this is not all what
is required for a project, for example.

- Database
  - sqlite (the most commonly DB used for local storage)
  - .csv or Excel (for saving information outside the DB application)
- Logic (Calculations)
  - Typescript To divide the application in modules so can be easily maintained, this
  technology bring several tools for a most maintainable code.
  - Node: for a easy testing for the developer.
- User Interface
  - material Design: To avoid develop the UI elements from zero
- Code management
  - Github: To have a easy way of distribution and backups.
