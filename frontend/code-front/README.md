# Calculadora MWD

## How to Use the Executables

The `calc_mwd_dist.zip` file contains all project executables:

* **`Calculadora-MWD-old-linux-x64/`**: This folder holds the
    Electron-generated executable for 64-bit Linux systems.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-old-windows-x64/`**: Similar to the above,
    but for Windows.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-server`**: This contains code for any static web
    server. It includes `server-linux.executable` and
    `server-windows.exe` to set up a simple local server.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-Android-installer.apk`**: The installer for
    Android. You'll need to **enable installation from unknown sources**
    to use it.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-windows-x64-installer-setup.exe`**: A standard
    Windows installer. It will install the software and dependencies,
    create desktop shortcuts, uninstaller, etc.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-windows-x64-portable.exe`**: This is just the
    calculator app. It relies on a web view component from your
    operating system. If it doesn't run, follow the
    *If the App Doesn't Run (Missing Web View)* instructions.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-linux-x64-installer.AppImage`**: A standard
    Linux installer. It will install the software and dependencies,
    create desktop shortcuts, uninstaller, etc.

* **`Calculadora-MWD-linux-x64-portable.executable`**: This is just the
    calculator app. It relies on a web view component from your
    operating system. If it doesn't run, follow the
    *If the App Doesn't Run (Missing Web View)* instructions.

### If the App Doesn't Run (Missing Web View)

Your app requires a web view component to display its interface. This
is usually pre-installed on modern systems. If the app doesn't launch,
follow the instructions for your operating system below.

#### For Windows Users

The app needs **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime**. It's often
pre-installed on Windows 11 and recent Windows 10 versions.

1. Go to the official Microsoft WebView2 download page:
   [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
2. Under "Evergreen Bootstrapper," click **Download** and run the
   installer. Follow the on-screen prompts.
3. Once installed, try running the application again.

---

#### For Linux Users

The app requires a web rendering engine, typically **WebKitGTK** or
**libwebkit2gtk**. Most modern Linux distributions include this. If
you encounter an error, you may need to install it.

Since there are many Linux distributions, the exact commands vary.
Here is an example commands to install it:

* **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt update &&  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev`

## Developer notes

### How to build

#### Install building tools

1, Install node following [these](https://nodejs.org/en/download) instructions.

2, Install sdkman following [these](https://sdkman.io/install/) instructions.

3, Using sdkman install java and groovy for details use [this](https://sdkman.io/usage/#latest-stable) reference

4, Install Android Studio and its dependencies using [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux) instructions

4, Install Tauri following [these](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) instructions.

These instructions were follow on a Linux machine and the setup end up with these versions.

```shell
$ lsb_release -a
# Description: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
# Codename: jammy

$ node -v
# v22.15.1

$ sdk version
# script: 5.18.1
# native: 0.2.2

$ java -version
# "21.0.7" 2025-04-15 LTS

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
# /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64

$ echo $NDK_HOME
# /home/m51/Android/Sdk/ndk/29.0.13113456

$ rustc --version
# 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)

$ tauri --version
# tauri-cli 2.5.0
```

#### Prepare project

1, unpack the file `calc_mwd_code.zip`

2, get inside the source code `cd calc_mwd/`

3, Download the project dependencies `npm install`

#### Build executables

**Note:** the main developing is focused on the tool Tauri, it was electron
added, because it has a major compatibility with old computers.

`npm run tauri-build-lin` it builds the installers (.deb and .appimage)
for Linux, and the portable too, it must generate the following files.

* Portable `src-tauri/target/release/mwdCalculator`

* Debian distros installer `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Calculadora MWD_0.1.0_amd64.deb`

* independent of specific Linux distributions installer: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/Calculadora MWD_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage`

`npm run tauri-build-win`: It builds the following executables for windows

* Portable: `src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/mwdCalculator.exe`

* Installer: `src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/Calculadora-MWD-x64-setup.exe`

`npm run tauri-build-android`: it builds the installer for Android the below path,
**IMPORTAN:** Check the files for sign apk, it should be the same mentioned on [this steps,](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/)

* Installer: `src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk`

`npm run electron-build-exe-lin` It builds the portable for old Linux
computers, but it contains the webview and the webApp on sight, ideal
for old computers or modern Operative systems without updates.

`npm run electron-build-exe-win` the same as the last command but for windows.

#### Steps to deploy on cloud

1, Build using command `npm run build-demo`

* Note: This scripts is configured to add a path `/calc_mwd/` which is were live my demos

2, Remplace the content in the repository `00_my_demos/calc_mwd` by the new one.

* Note: check that index is a calc_mwd/index.html

3, In the repository `/00_my_demos/calc_mwd` commit and push

4, Go to netlify > look for my_demos repository > press deploy button
